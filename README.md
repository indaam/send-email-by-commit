# Summary
When you work, maybe on something employe. Then everyday you must be send report about you jobs or task per day. Swear is anoying by me. Why, for what?
But if its require, you must do that.
Before you send the report, somethimes you must remember what you do in this day, better if you remember, if not? I think you open the sourcetress or trello, or whatever lah.
So, why not create base on commit?

## Think
This application, send email report base on commit

## install & config
* clone this repo
* put on our project
* cd this_repo, the npm i
* open CONFIG.js


## Application Flow

## ignore commit
even you say, coding is game, coding is poetry. whatever bla bla
Sometimes coding is not good lah, I hope someone know what I mean.
And then, upon once a time, you create commit like this
* `git commit -m  "F*ck feature"`
* `git commit -m  "Stup*d client"`
* `git commit -m  "Stup*d you boss"`

Itis not good lah, canot la send report like that. So to ignore commit, you can edit CONFIG.js then ignore commit base on word

## Base on Hastag
By default this application grab all commit start from 00.00 to 24.00, so if you want add spesifik commit, you can use hastag, sampe like this.
* `git commit -m  "#complate: Create Home screen"`

to do that, go to config.js than change to true
